## Plotting the Null Clines and Vector Field
where the nullcline equations need to be solved and plotted over a grid

## Interpretation
Nullclines: The nullclines are the curves where the time derivatives are zero, meaning the system does not change in one of the variables. The intersection of the nullclines gives the equilibrium point of the system.

Vector Field: The vector field plotted by quiver shows the direction of the system's evolution at different points in the phase space. By observing this, we can glimpse periodic solutions (limit cycles), as the vectors tend to rotate around certain regions, indicating oscillatory behavior.
